According to a news release, Enviro-Master uses a non-toxic, non-corrosive and food-safe germicide that's dispensed from an electrostatic sprayer, basically the equivalent of a proton pack for germs. 

Enviro-Master of Detroit's owner, Ketura Brandes, came up with the idea after the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services announced a three-week closure for indoor dining at restaurants. Brandes aimed this drive-thru service at food delivery drivers, who would see an increase in delivery orders as a result of the shutdown. 

Brandes then decided to expand the sanitization service to law enforcement, first responders, Uber and Lyft drivers. 

Despite the virus being fragile and not surviving easily outside of the human body, according to a report by the Associated Press, experts still recommend cleaning frequently touched areas.</font></div>
